# MontyPython-Snake-Game

## Description:

The MontyPython-Snake-Game is a classic arcade-style Snake game inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python. In this game, you control a pixelated snake and try to navigate it around the screen to collect food and grow longer without hitting the walls or running into yourself.

## Requirements:

Python 3.x
Pygame library (pip install pygame)
How to Play:

Run the game by executing the MontyPython-Snake-Game.py script.
The snake will start moving automatically towards the right direction.
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, and Right) to change the snake's direction.
The snake will eat food that appears on the screen, which causes it to grow longer.
Avoid running the snake into the screen boundaries or into itself, as this will end the game.
The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
Your score increases each time the snake eats food, and the game displays the highest score achieved during the session.

## Implementation Details:

The game uses Pygame to create a graphical window where the gameplay takes place.
The snake is represented as a series of rectangles, with the head being a different color from the body segments.
Food items are represented as simple circles of a distinctive color.
The game uses a game loop to continuously update the screen, handle user input, and move the snake.
The snake's movement is controlled using a list that holds the snake's segments, and its head is updated based on user input and previous positions.
Food appears at random positions on the screen, and the snake's length increases when it eats the food.
Collision detection is used to check if the snake runs into the boundaries of the screen or collides with itself, which leads to the game ending.
